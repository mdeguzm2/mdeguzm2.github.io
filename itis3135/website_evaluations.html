                <h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a></h3>
                <p>Steam is one of the largest PC game stores and is owned by Valve. Steam contains various ways for communities to interact with each other and for people to connect with their friends.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Steam has good contrast from the dark blue background with mainly white text with some brighter blue text. Divs use different shades of blue darker or lighter enough to stand out while still staying on theme.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: Steam shows good repetition where boxes for each section of the site are all the same size.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: Steam consistently uses a center align for all objects.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Items are all consistently spaced from each other but are still in close proximity. Text is also placed with enough space around while still being near borders or other text.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
                <p>Arngren appears to be a site for selling various gadgets, appliances, and cars.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Although Arngren does use colors that contrast with each other, there are several bright colored text being used over the white background, which makes the site not appear to be using a color scheme.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: There is basically no repetition on this site as every image looks to be a different size, font has varying sizes, text is randomly bold.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: Arngren doesn't have anything aligned, every image is just right next to each other except for a few that are lined up.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Everything on the site is too close to something else, there is very little space in between each image and the menu.</li>
                </ul>
