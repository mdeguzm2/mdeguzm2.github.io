                <p>Building a PC is a rewarding experience that allows you to customize your system to your exact needs. Here are some basic facts to get you started:</p>
                <h3>Essential Components:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motherboard: The backbone of your PC, connecting all the components together.</li>
                    <li>CPU (Central Processing Unit): The brain of your PC, handling calculations and instructions.</li>
                    <li>RAM (Random Access Memory): Short-term memory for running applications.</li>
                    <li>Storage: Holds your data (HDD or SSD).</li>
                    <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU): Provides power to all components.</li>
                    <li>Case: Houses all the components and protects them.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Compatibility:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure all components are compatible with each other, especially the motherboard, CPU, and RAM. 
                        The website <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartpicker</a> will show what is compatible and what isn't.</li>
                    <li>Check for form factor compatibility (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX).</li>    
                </ul>
            </section>

                <p>As someone who has been interested in computers for a long time, building them has always been something that I have been interested in doing, even after building multiple.
                    I originally started off building a PC with an Intel i3-6100 and a GTX 750ti but would later on build several more. 
                </p>
                <p>Currently, I have been more interested in small-form-factor case builds and my current PC is in a very compact case, as seen in the image above.</p>

                <p>When preparing to build a PC, these are some of the best times to purchase parts:</p>
                <h3>Major Sales Events:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Black Friday and Cyber Monday: These annual sales events often offer significant discounts on PC components, making it a great time to build a PC.</li>
                    <li>Retailer-Specific Sales: Keep an eye out for sales from retailers like Best Buy, Micro Center, and Newegg.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>New Hardware Releases:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>New CPU Releases: When new generations of CPUs are released, older generations often become more affordable. This is a good time to build a PC if you're looking for a budget-friendly option.</li>
                    <li>New GPU Releases: Similar to CPUs, new GPU releases can drive down the prices of older models, making it a good time to build a PC for gaming or other graphics-intensive tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                <p>When looking for parts to buy, there are some sites that offer better prices, service, and availability than others. The following are some that I recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Microcenter:
                        <ul> 
                            <li>In terms of pricing and service, Microcenter is likely the best option 
                            with their prices being much lower than competition due to most items being in store purchases only as well as many bundle deals and discounts.</li>
                            <li>Microcenter's employees offer to help anyone and can create an entire build list while at the store.</li>
                            <li>The main drawback is that they do not have many stores and not in many states.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>2. Newegg:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Newegg is one of the most popular stores to buy parts, as it being online makes it one of the most accessible with some of the best inventory.</li>
                            <li>Their prices are usually going to be the lowest you can find online but will unfortunately not be as good as Microcenter's.</li>
                            <li>Something to look out for when purchasing through Newegg is that they have some negative reviews about customers receving previously returned damaged items.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>3. Others:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Outside of these 2, there can be other sites with similar or better pricing occasionally but likely won't be as consistent.</li>
                            <li>The website, <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartpicker</a> can be helpful with choosing where to purchase a part, as it displays the store with the lowest price for each one.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <p>Although many PC's parts may have a different order/way to be built together, most follow this format:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Before working with any of the parts, if unfamiliar with where they should go, it is best to read the motherboard and case's manuals.</li>
                    <li>It is generally best to start working with the motherboard first (since you have more space), which means placing the CPU, RAM, SSD (if NVME/m.2) and CPU cooler in their correct spots. 
                        Make sure to plug the CPU cooler's fan's connector in to the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.</li>
                    <li>You would then want to make sure the standoffs to screw the motherboard to the case are on, then place and screw in the motherboard to the case.</li>
                    <li>The next part would be connecting the case cables to the motherboard. The cables will be labeled and you can find the correct connections in the motherboard's manual.</li>
                    <li>You can then install the power supply, in which its location depends on the case design.</li>
                    <li>The power supply will have several cables that need to be connected, the ones labeled CPU-8PIN and ATX-24PIN will be connected to the motherboard.</li>
                    <li>You can now install other parts, such as a discrete graphics card, fans, SATA SSDs, etc. Make sure they are connected with their appropriate power supply cables.</li>

                <p>Thinking about building a PC but not sure yet? Here are some reasons why you might want to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customization: You can choose every component to suit your specific needs, whether it's gaming, content creation, or general use.</li>
                    <li>Cost Efficiency: Often, building your own PC can be more cost-effective than buying a pre-built system. You can allocate your budget where it matters most.</li>
                    <li>Better Performance: By selecting high-quality parts, you can create a machine that outperforms many stock systems, especially for demanding tasks.</li>
                    <li>Upgrade Flexibility: Building your own PC makes it easier to upgrade individual components in the future without needing to replace the entire system.</li>
                    <li>Aesthetic Appeal: You can customize the look of your PC with various cases, RGB lighting, and cooling options to match your style.</li>
