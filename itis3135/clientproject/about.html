                <h2>Current Waste Management Infrastructure in Tokyo</h2>
                    <p>The current waste management infrastructure in Tokyo relies on user end sorting and garbage separation through the use of multiple waste receptacles. 
                        The action of separating waste into categories (burnable, non-burnable, glass, metal, etc.) in theory allows for more waste to be recycled and properly processed. 
                        However, the lack of convenience in simply having one waste receptacle leads to large amounts of waste being miscategorized and unorganized. 
                        By creating a fully mechanized waste sorting system, waste is able to be more efficiently sorted into its proper categories and distributed respectively. 
                        Underground and above ground pipe systems transport waste without the need of specific waste pick up times and systems, and utilize existing infrastructure such as metros to distribute waste.</p>
                <h2>Neighborhood Recycling Centers</h2>
                    <p>After widespread implementation of this waste management system, neighborhood recycling centers can be established to educate the public and create a community and culture around recycling waste.</p>
                <h2>Community Waste Depository and Creative Spaces</h2>
                    <p>These structures will “plug in” to the existing waste network, as well as providing a local depository for community waste. As well as being infrastructural, 
                        these centers will provide space for local creatives and artists to transform raw recycled materials into various commodities and artworks that will be displayed and sold locally. 
                        Workspaces are segmented in relation to the material handled.</p>
                <h2>The CYCLE: A New Building Typology</h2>
                    <p>The CYCLE stands as an example of a new building typology which can be replicated in numerous neighborhoods and be linked into the overall waste management network. 
                        Through a segmented and modular design, the CYCLE emphasizes its infrastructural nature as well as providing room for expansion through addition of modules. 
                        The CYCLE utilizes prefabricated building strategies such as prefabricated concrete panels and steel components allowing for an easily replicable and inexpensive construction.</p>
